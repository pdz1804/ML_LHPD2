## Purpose

This directory organizes all data related to the project, including raw data, processed data, final datasets used for modeling, and any additional data storage.

---

## Subdirectories

*   **`raw/`**:  This directory contains the original, unprocessed datasets.  It might also contain scripts or notebooks used to download the data.
*   **`processed/`**: This directory contains data that has been cleaned and transformed.  Processed data should be saved in a standardized format, such as CSV or Parquet.
*   **`final/`**: This directory contains the final datasets, ready for model training or evaluation. These datasets have typically been through feature engineering.
*   **`store/`**: This directory is used for backup or additional data storage, such as cached files or data from external sources.

## Downloading the Data

There are two ways to obtain the data for this project:

1.  **Self-Downloading using the Notebook:** If you prefer to download the data yourself, run the `data_download.ipynb` notebook located in the `data/raw/` directory. This notebook contains the code necessary to download the raw data from its original source.
2.  **Download Preprocessed Data:** Alternatively, you can download the preprocessed dataset directly from Kaggle: [Tweets Clean POS/NEG V1](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zphudzz/tweets-clean-posneg-v1). This dataset has already been cleaned and prepared for use.

## Data Usage

*   Ensure that you understand the license and terms of use for any data you download, whether from the original source or from Kaggle.
*   Document any data transformations or cleaning steps you perform on the data.
*   Store processed data in a consistent and well-documented format.
