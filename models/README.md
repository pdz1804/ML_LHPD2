# Models Directory

This directory serves as the central repository for all trained machine learning models and their associated artifacts. It contains different versions of trained models, along with supporting data like training logs and performance visualizations.

## Purpose

This directory helps organize and version control your trained models, making it easier to:

*   Track different versions of your models as you experiment and improve them.
*   Reproduce past results by accessing the corresponding trained models, logs, and visualizations.
*   Understand the evolution of your models over time.
*   Share your trained models and their associated data with others.

---

## Key Components

*   **Versioned Subdirectories (e.g., `Ver01_25_02_23`, `Ver02_25_02_25`):**  Each subdirectory represents a specific version of the trained models. The directory name typically includes a date or version number.
*   **`img/` (Within Versioned Subdirectories):** Contains images visualizing the model's performance during training (e.g., loss curves, accuracy plots, k-fold validation results).
*   **`trained/` (Within Versioned Subdirectories):** Contains the serialized, fully trained model files that can be loaded and used for prediction.  The specific file format depends on the training framework used (e.g., `.pkl` for scikit-learn, `.h5` for Keras).
*   **`training_log/` (Within Versioned Subdirectories):** Contains log files capturing the details of the training process, including hyperparameters, epoch-level metrics, and any errors or warnings.
*   **`README.md` (Within Each Directory):** Provides documentation specific to that directory, explaining its contents and how to use the trained models.

## Versioning Strategy

The directory structure uses a simple versioning scheme based on dates.  Each time you significantly retrain or modify your models, create a new versioned subdirectory (e.g., `Ver03_YY_MM_DD`) to store the updated models and data.  This ensures that you can always access and reproduce past results. The `other/` directory should be used to store all supporting files such as preprocessing scripts, train/test splits, and anything else that is not the training logs, image results, or the serialized trained model.

## How to Use

1.  **Browse the Versioned Subdirectories:**  Explore the different versioned subdirectories to find the specific model version you are interested in.
2.  **Consult the `README.md`:**  Read the `README.md` file within the versioned subdirectory to understand the contents of that directory and how to use the trained models.
3.  **Load the Trained Models:**  Load the serialized model files from the `trained/` directory using the appropriate framework-specific methods (e.g., `joblib.load()` for scikit-learn, `tf.keras.models.load_model()` for TensorFlow).
4.  **Refer to the Training Logs and Images:**  Use the training logs in `training_log/` and the images in `img/` to understand the model's training process and performance characteristics.
5.  **Utilize the `other/` directory:** For versions that contain an `other/` directory, consult the relevant files to understand more about that specific model version.
