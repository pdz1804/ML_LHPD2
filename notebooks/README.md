## Kaggle Notebooks

The `kaggle` directory up to now contains the following notebooks:

*   `run_v01.ipynb`
*   `run_v02.ipynb`

These notebooks were designed to be run on Kaggle, leveraging Kaggle's free GPU resources for training. The notebooks are structured to take advantage of Kaggle's features for saving and running notebooks in a cloud environment with GPU acceleration.
