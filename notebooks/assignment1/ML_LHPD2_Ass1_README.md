## 📝 **I. Group Project Requirements**

### **1️⃣ Project Organization**
✅ **Group Formation**:
- The group consists of **5 members**.
- **Nguyen Quang Phu** is the **repository owner**.

✅ **Collaboration Workflow**:
- The **main repository** is managed by the designated team member.
- Other members **fork** the repository and contribute via **pull requests**.
- **Roles and responsibilities** are clearly defined for each team member.

---

### **2️⃣ GitHub Repository Structure**
We are implementing **ALL machine learning models from the syllabus** using:
- **ONE unified dataset** with one use-case before the midterm (Chapters 2-6) (which we do in this Assignment - Assignment 1).
- **THAT dataset** for that same use-case for the second stage after midterm (Chapters 6-10) (which we will do in our Assignment 2).

✅ **Repository Setup**:
- The **main repository** is created by the team lead.
- Team members **fork** and contribute via **pull requests**.
- **Branching strategy** is used for different models and features.
- **Comprehensive documentation** is maintained.

📌 **Suggested Repository Structure**:

```
📂 Project-Root 
│── 📂 data/            # Raw & Processed Datasets 
│── 📂 notebooks/       # Jupyter Notebooks for EDA & Preprocessing 
│── 📂 models/          # ML Model Implementations 
│── 📂 other/           # Some other related things here
│── 📂 reports/         # Contain figures and Reports
│── 📂 src/             # Contain src code of how to process data, build features and train the models
│── 📂 tests/           # Evaluation Results & Comparisons 
│── 📜 README.md        # Project Documentation 
│── 📜 requirements.txt # Dependencies
```

---

### **3️⃣ Key Requirements**
✅ Well-documented problem statements & model variations  
✅ Consistent structure for model implementations  
✅ Comprehensive testing of all components  
✅ Comparative analysis of models

## 📌 **V. How to Run This Project**

### 1️⃣ **Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/pdz1804/ML_LHPD2
cd ML_LHPD2
```

### 2️⃣ Setting Up the Environment

If you want to train the model in local (on your computer, in VSC...), to install the necessary dependencies, refer to the environment file (```environment.yml```) provided in the repository. Ensure you have Conda installed to create and activate the required environment.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate ml_env  # Replace ml_env with your environment name
```

### 3️⃣ **Explore the Project**

- First, you should revisit the Project structure above to see what is the use of those folders and subfolders in this project.
- In details:
    - To know how we collect all the data, visit the ```data``` folder.
    - To see the final preprocessing dataset, visiting this link: [Tweets Clean PosNeg v1](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zphudzz/tweets-clean-posneg-v1)  
    - To know how we preprocessing, make all the datasets consistent and how do we merge them together, visit the location ```src/data/process.ipynb``` and its utility file ```src/data/preprocess.py``` 
    - To know how and what we use to make the features for all the texts/documents in the dataset, visit the location ```src/features/build_features_utils.py``` 
    - To know how we perform hyperparameter tuning, do k-fold cross-validation and train our models, visit ```src/models/models_utils.py``` and ```src/models/train_model.ipynb``` 
    - We have also created some visualization functions inside the location ```src/visualization/```. Although now we have not used it anywhere in code because all the visualization or plotting now we just use the **in-line-function-plotting**, but we intend to use it later in Assignment 2.
    - The ```environment.yml``` contains the information about the libraries or dependencies that we use when performing and executing our project.
