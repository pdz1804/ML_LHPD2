\section{Future Developments}

Building upon the foundation established in this assignment, our future work will focus on advancing our sentiment analysis system through more sophisticated machine learning techniques, deep learning or modern approaches The key areas of improvement will include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Ensemble Methods:} Develop robust sentiment classifiers using bagging and boosting techniques, incorporating voting and model combination strategies to improve predictive performance.
    \item \textbf{Engineering Optimization:} Improve efficiency in handling large-scale text data by focusing on model scalability, memory-efficient implementation, and parameter optimization techniques.
    \item \textbf{Model Generalization and Performance Analysis:} Evaluate model robustness across different datasets, assess feature importance, and refine hyperparameter tuning methods.
\end{itemize}

By integrating these advanced techniques, our goal is to enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability of our sentiment analysis system. Through rigorous experimentation and optimization, we aim to develop a more reliable model that can generalize well across diverse textual datasets. This next phase will further solidify our expertise in sentiment analysis, bridging the gap between theory and real-world applications.
