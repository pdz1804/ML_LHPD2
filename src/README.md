# Introduction

The `src/` directory contains all the source code required for data processing, feature engineering, model training, and visualization. Each subdirectory is organized to facilitate a structured and maintainable workflow, promoting collaboration and ease of understanding.

**Explanation**:

- **`data/`**: Contains scripts to load datasets, clean data, and prepare it for modeling.
    - `__init__.py`:  An empty file that indicates that the `data` directory should be treated as a Python package.
    - `make_dataset.py`: This script is responsible for creating and loading the dataset. It may include functions to download the data from a source or read it from a local file.
    - `preprocess.py`: This script contains functions for data preprocessing steps, such as cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data for modeling.
    - `process_v0.ipynb` and `process_v1.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebooks that likely contain exploratory data analysis (EDA) and initial data processing steps. The 'v0' and 'v1' likely indicate different versions or iterations of the processing workflow.
- **`features/`**: Includes feature engineering scripts, such as feature selection and transformation.
    - `__init__.py`:  An empty file that indicates that the `features` directory should be treated as a Python package.
    - `build_features_utils.py`: This script contains utility functions to help build new features from the existing data.
    - `example.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that provides an example or demonstration of how to use the feature engineering utilities.
- **`models/`**: Houses scripts for training, testing, and deploying machine learning models.
    - `__init__.py`:  An empty file that indicates that the `models` directory should be treated as a Python package.
    - `models_utils.py`: This script contains utility functions for model training, evaluation, and saving/loading models.
    - `train_test_model_v0.ipynb` and `train_test_model_v1.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebooks that implement the model training and testing pipeline.  The different versions likely represent improvements or variations in the modeling approach.
- **`visualization/`**: Provides tools for visualizing data distributions, model performance, and results.
    - `__init__.py`:  An empty file that indicates that the `visualization` directory should be treated as a Python package.
    - `visualize_v0.ipynb` and `visualize_v1.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebooks used for creating visualizations of the data and model results. The versions indicate iterations or different approaches to visualization.
    - `visualize.py`: A Python script containing functions to generate common visualizations, which can be reused throughout the project.
- **`README.md`**: Documents the purpose and structure of this directory.

This structured organization ensures that the codebase is modular, scalable, and easy to maintain.
