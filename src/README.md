# Introduction

The `src/` directory contains all the source code required for data processing, feature engineering, model training, and visualization. Each subdirectory is organized to facilitate a structured and maintainable workflow.

# Directory Structure

```
ðŸ“‚ src/                        # Main source code directory  
â”‚â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ data/                   # Scripts for loading, cleaning, and preprocessing data  
â”‚â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ features/               # Feature engineering and selection scripts  
â”‚â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ models/                 # Model training, evaluation, and inference scripts  
â”‚â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ visualization/          # Scripts for generating plots and visual analysis  
â”‚â”€â”€ ðŸ“œ README.md               # Documentation for the `src/` directory  
```

**Explanation**:

- **`data/`**: Contains scripts to load datasets, clean data, and prepare it for modeling.  
- **`features/`**: Includes feature engineering scripts, such as feature selection and transformation.  
- **`models/`**: Houses scripts for training, testing, and deploying machine learning models.  
- **`visualization/`**: Provides tools for visualizing data distributions, model performance, and results.  
- **`README.md`**: Documents the purpose and structure of this directory.  

This structured organization ensures that the codebase is modular, scalable, and easy to maintain.
